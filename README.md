## DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

The purpose of this project was to refactor, or restructure
the existing code that was given to me, so that it upheld
accessibility standards and search engine optimization standards. 

I made sure to change the HTML non-semantic elements to semantic elements and organized the headings; I consolidated, organized, and commented on the CSS; I added alternative descriptions to the images; and made sure that the navigational links were working.

There was no actual change made to the styling or content of the page, which can
be seen below.
